var locationButtonScript = "I want you to make me a script to talk to air traffic control as if I am a pilot flying a general aviation plane. The purpose of this radio call is to give a location update of my whereabouts. Write what I would need to say to give a location update. Keep it in a professional tone like a pilot and only say the parts that I need to say nothing else. For the parts that say my location and airspeed, leave them blank and replace it with underlines so I can fill them in myself."
